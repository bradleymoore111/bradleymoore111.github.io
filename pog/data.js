These renovations were intended to make patrons feel more comfortable entering a pornographic film establishment and to also hide potentially offensive imagery from the general public. Miranda promoted merchandise and designed many souvenirs for clientele to help with marketing.  He was the face of Pussycat Theaters and therefore, his name was often used in newspaper articles and court documents. A close friend and falsely rumored romantic interest, Rose Marie, wrote \"He took pride in running the Pussycat Theatres. Although they were porno theaters, he ran them like a business,\" in her memoir <i>Hold the Roses</i>.

Its premier caused massive controversy across the nation and helped facilitate the shortlived \"porno chic\" era, in which it was well-received to view pornography in public theaters. This movie brought out protests from anti-pornography groups. As this movie was originally distributed through the Mafia and other criminal groups, it was heavily investigated by the FBI and local police to limit trafficking of \"obscene materials\" within California. They actually convicted the mafia and the male lead, Harry Reems (Herbert John Streicher), who was thrown under the bus by his co-star Linda Lovelace (Linda Susan Boreman) as well as director/writer Gerard Damiano. Lovelace made multiple appearances at Pussycat theaters, even leaving her handprints in front of the Hollywood location. The Santa Monica Pussycat was one of the first theaters to show this film.
