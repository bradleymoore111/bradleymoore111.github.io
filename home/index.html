					Welcome to my website! I'm Bradley, and I am a student unofficially learning various programming languages.<br><br>

					I have the most experience with Javascript logic and working Javascript into HTML, plus Java and a little C++. I'm currently learning Ruby on rails, and have a fairly large small amount of experience working with 2D HTML canvas' and graphical renderings. I've helped create eshsgaming and subpargaming.com as a website, helped maintain a server for our local community, and spend more time on a computer than I do sleeping. <br><br>

					Outside of my interest in computers, I have a strong passion for music, and especially feel strongly towards clarinet. I have 8 years of experience playing clarinet, and recently I've learned to play saxophone reasonably well, and am currently learning piano. I originally started playing with the elementary school program, and was part of the first 4th grade class in our school district to be offered this chance. Since then I've advanced with friends and players even better than me til my current grade as a senior. I was placed in advanced band as a sixth grader in the middle school as sixth chair out of seven, later advancing to fourth that year. Seventh grade first chair was passed between myself and Eric Liu, a friend of mine, before he moved, leaving the title open without competition. High school marching band has been the greatest experience of my life, forming a family, friendships, and drive along with changing my life and motivation towards life. I've played in the local community band since 8th grade where I tried out for and successfully made alls southern honor band which was a blast. I went to Idyllwild for 3 summer camps (2010-2012), along with numerous summer symposiums hosted at the local high school. I play in a saxophone quartet locally, a woodwind trio with friends, and very heavily enjoy the musical opportunities offered. I plan to continue playing msuic for my entire life, and out of all the activities I've participated in, msuic has been the most enjoyable experience yet.<br><br>
